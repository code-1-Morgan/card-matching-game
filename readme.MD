## How It's Made:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript


## Lessons Learned:
This project has a higher volume of JavaScript code than any other project I've done. One of the biggest challenges to completing this was keeping the code organized and keeping close track of the order of functions use. I even made a flow chart to further understand the order of operations necessary for the project. This is also the first project where I've heavily utilized class selectors in JavaScript.
